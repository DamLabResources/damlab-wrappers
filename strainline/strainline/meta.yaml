description: Wrapper for running strainline haplotype reconstruction
authors:
  - Will Dampier, PhD
input:
  - reads in FASTQ format
output:
  - directory containing all results OR
  - FASTA file containing haplotype sequences
params:
  - prefix: installation prefix for strainline
  - platform: sequencing platform (pb or ont)
  - extra_args: extra arguments to pass to strainline
notes: |
  * The wrapper runs strainline for haplotype-aware assembly of long reads
  * Input must be in FASTQ format
  * Output can be either a directory with all results or a single FASTA file with haplotypes
  * Requires strainline to be installed via the provided makefile to the prefix defined in the params
  * Number of threads can be controlled via snakemake threads directive
  * stderr is redirected to the snakemake log if specified
